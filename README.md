chefkart assignment


Steps:
1. clone/fork/download repository
2. npm install
3. npm run dev


NOTE:
I created the web-app for mobile version, and the assignment instructions given said viewport to be 360px wide, so the page is desgined for a screen width of 360px.
So, it is best to view the site by changing the view size in inspect element to 360px or to samsung galaxy s8+(width is 360px).
